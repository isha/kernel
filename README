This directory contains the source code for the Xeros operating system
which is a desicated version of the Xinu OS[1].

To build a Xeros image, type make in this directoy. If you want to
launch bochs type "make beros". This commnad will first build a Xeros
image and then start the bochs emulator.  (You can also go to the c
directory, where the source code you are editing resides, and run the
same make commands there.)  

When you run make or make xeros the first two steps below are are
performed. If you run beros then all 3 steps are done.

1. Change to the compile directory and run make

2. If step 1 succeeds, a boot image is built by changing to the compile
directory and running make there. 

3) If step 3 succeeds, bochs is run.

If you simply type make you can, assuming there was a clean make,
execute the resulting image by simply executing the bochs command in
this directory (i.e.   nice bochs) 

Once bochs is running, choose option 6 to start the simulation and to
load and run the created image.
